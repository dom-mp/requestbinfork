### Implementation Details

- Front-end is a single-page web app built with React + TypeScript + [vite](https://vite.dev/) and [material ui](https://mui.com/).
- Back-end is implemented with [express.js](https://expressjs.com/).
- Basket and request metadata are stored in PostgreSQL.
- Request payload data is stored in MongoDB.
- State persistence is implemented via browser local storage, allowing users to access the same baskets across sessions.

## Requirements

In the `backend` directory, create a `.env` file with the following contents:

```env
# PostgreSQL configuration
PGHOST=localhost
PGDATABASE=requestbin
PGPORT=5432           # Default PostgreSQL port
PGUSER=postgres       # Replace with your PostgreSQL username
PGPASSWORD=postgres   # Replace with your PostgreSQL password

# MongoDB configuration
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017 # Default MongoDB URI

# Application port
PORT=3000             # Port the backend server will run on
```

💡**Note:** Ensure that PostgreSQL and MongoDB are installed and running locally with the above credentials. You may need to adjust these values to match your environment.

## Installation

Navigate to the `backend` directory

```bash
cd backend
```

Build the full project

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the application

```bash
npm start
```

If serving on `nginx`:

```bash
npm run nginx
```

- copies contents of `dist/` to `/var/www/requestbin`
- dist/ should be built with `npm run build` or `npm run build:frontend` first.
